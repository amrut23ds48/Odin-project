    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spanish-style French toast, or torrijas, is basically French toast, bread pudding, and creme brulee all rolled into one, and it is nothing short of magical.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>   
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 loaf of bread (preferably stale)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar for serving</li>
        <li>1 cup olive oil, or as needed, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine milk, white sugar, salt, orange zest, lemon zest, cinnamon, cloves, and vanilla in a saucepan, whisk, and bring to a simmer over medium-heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain milk through a mesh strainer and transfer 2 cups into a shallow dish in which to soak stale bread; set aside.</li>
        <li>Transfer remaining 2 cups infused milk into a saucepan to make the custard sauce; add yolks and whisk thoroughly. Return saucepan to medium-low heat, and cook, stirring with a spatula and scraping the bottom constantly, until the mixture gets hot and thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat; immediately pour through a fine mesh strainer. Let cool and refrigerate until needed. </li>
        <li>Soak stale bread in milk, turning a few times, until most of milk is absorbed and bread is saturated. Remove to a pan or plate and refrigerate until needed. </li>
        <li>Beat whole eggs in a wide shallow bowl. Coat bread on both sides in the egg. </li>
        <li>Pour olive oil, 1/4  to 1/2 inch deep into a nonstick skillet, and heat over medium heat. Fry soaked bread in the hot oil until browned and puffed, about 4 minutes per side. When fully cooked, the bread will spring back when touched in the center.</li>
        <li>Remove to a plate. Top each slice with 1 tablespoon turbinado sugar. Use a blowtorch with a low flame to brûlée the surface. Serve immediately with custard sauce.</li>
