    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Add onion and bell pepper; cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. Stir in the cooked sausage mixture.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the tater tots in the prepared baking dish. Pour half of the egg mixture over the tater tots. Sprinkle with half of the cheese. Repeat layers with remaining tater tots, egg mixture, and cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the casserole is set and the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Let the casserole cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your Tater Tot breakfast casserole!</li>
